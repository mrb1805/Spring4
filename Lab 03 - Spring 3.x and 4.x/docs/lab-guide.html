New features of Spring 3.x and 4.x</h1><h2 id="Spring3.0enhancements">Spring 3.0 enhancements</h2><p>The first thing we will do is check out some of the new features introduced in Spring 3.x</p><h3 id="UsingELinxmlconfiguration">Using EL in xml configuration</h3><p>Expressions, <em>#{expr}</em> can now be used throughout the framework now from 3.0 onwards. It&#8217;s the easiest way possible now for setting bean properties wherever possible.</p><p>We will do a small example in which we will try to read some system propertie using EL. Start by reviewing <code>ErrorHandler</code> class from <code>ex1</code> package. According the code, we need to initialize the <em>defaultLocale</em> property. Open <code>ex1-config-1.xml</code> file and complete <code>TODO 1</code> by referring to <b>slide no. 77</b> to use EL for initializing the <em>defaultLocale</em>.</p><p>Run the <code>ErrorHandlerTest</code> class to test whether EL is working or not.</p><h3 id="UsingELviaannotations">Using EL via annotations</h3><p>We need to use <em>@Value</em> annotation to initialize bean properties using EL. The advantage of this annotation is also the same as other annotations, it can be used at the field level directly. Open <code>ErrorHandler2</code> class and complete <code>TODO 2</code> by referring to <b>slide no. 78</b>. </p><p>Run <code>ErrorHandlerTest2</code> to see if @Value annotation is working or not.</p><p>Also try out using Elvis/Ternary operator when using EL as seen on <b>slide no. 79</b>.</p><h3 id="UsingELtoaccesspropertyvalueofanotherbean">Using EL to access property value of another bean</h3><p>As you can see on <b>slide no. 80</b>, we can use EL to read/get the properties of other beans. Create your own Java classes to try this out. Also using EL, we can invoke any method of other beans &amp; pass parameters, if time permits, do try this as well. </p><h3 id="Collectionselectionandprojection">Collection selection and projection</h3><p>As discussed on <b>slide no. 81-82</b>, review the <code>ProductList</code> class from <code>ex1</code> package. <code>ProductListTest</code> class contains the code to test this feature.</p><h2 id="NewfeaturesofSpring3.1">New features of Spring 3.1</h2><h3 id="BeanProfiles">Bean Profiles</h3><p><b>Slide no. 83</b> explains the concept of Bean definition profiles. Now it&#8217;s easy to group set of beans under a common name. All what we need to do is specify the profile name when launching the application either by setting a system property or as a context-param in web.xml file. <code>ex2-config-1.xml</code> contains the configuration for this example. To test the same, please run <code>FlightRepositoryTest</code> class from the <code>ex2</code> package.</p><h3 id="Caching">Caching</h3><p>One more new feature of Spring is support for Caching. Any POJO method which returns an Object can be cached. You can start by reviewing <code>FlightRepositoryImpl</code> from <code>ex3</code> package. Next we need to setup the cache provider, for which the configuration can be found in <code>ex3-config-1.xml</code> file. Finally, you can test the working of this example by running the <code>FlightRepositoryTest</code> class from the same package. Refer <b>slide no. 85 &#8211; 88</b> if required.</p><h2 id="Spring3.0Annotationbasedcontainerconfiguration">Spring 3.0 Annotation based container configuration</h2><p>Refer to <b>slide no. 89-91</b> for details.</p><p>This is one of the interesting features of Spring 3.0. The concept of xml been replaced by annotations completely. Start by reviewing <code>AppConfig</code> class from <code>ex4</code> package carefully and see if you are clear with the intent of this code. Also review the other dependent classes as well.</p><p>Open <code>AppConfigTest</code> class and see how this time we created an ApplicationContext instance without supplying any xml. Refer to <b>slide no. 106</b> for details. Run the test class and see if you are clear with the working of the same.</p><p>Please see to it that you are very clear with what&#8217;s the difference this time. Plese let me know in case of any difficulty.</p><h2 id="CoreSpring4.0improvements">Core Spring 4.0 improvements</h2><p>Spring 4 has introduced lot&#8217;s of improvement at the core IoC/DI level. Apart from this areas like MVC, Caching &amp; JMS has<br/>also been improved, but that is not the intention of this lab right now.  </p><h3 id="ConditionAPI">Condition API</h3><p>To understand this feature, please refer to <b>slide no. 93.95</b> for details. Also i have shared a <b>README.txt</b> file<br/>inside <code>ex5</code> package to help you understand the working. So it looks like this lab guide is of now use now ;-)</p><h3 id="Orderingofinjectingdependencies">Ordering of injecting dependencies</h3><p>Start by reading the <b>README.txt</b> file from <code>ex6</code> package to understand the concept. <b>Slide no. 96</b> refers to the example in <code>ex6</code> package. Run the test class as usual.</p><h3 id="GenericssupportinDI">Generics support in DI</h3><p>Start by reading the <b>README.txt</b> file from <code>ex7</code> package to understand the concept. <b>Slide no. 97-98</b> refers to the example in <code>ex7</code> package. Run the test class as usual.</p><h3 id="Lazilyinjectingdependencies">Lazily injecting dependencies</h3><p>Start by reading the <b>README.txt</b> file from <code>ex8</code> package to understand the concept. <b>Slide no. 99</b> refers to the example in <code>ex8</code> package. Run the test class as usual.</p><h1 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h1><p>In this very important lab, we saw lot&#8217;s of new features introduced in Spring framework. In the next lab, we will cover lifecycle and other core concepts.</p></body></html>
