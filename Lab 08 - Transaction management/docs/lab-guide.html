These entities are the ones which have been mapped to the respective tables in the database.</li><li>Next we have 3 repository classes in this example, <code>OrderRepository</code> , <code>PaymentRepository</code> and <code>ProductRepository</code>. Please go through with the respective implementation classes as well.</li><li>Now have a look at <code>OnlineShoppingService</code> interface and it&#8217;s implementation <code>OnlineShoppingServiceImpl</code> defined in the <code>service</code> package. This service class will act as an entry point in the application. The diagram below gives you a quick idea about the overall configuration.</li></ul><p><img border="0" src="flow.jpg"/> </p><p>Since we are using annotations, only the infrastructure configuration is found in <code>ex-config.xml</code> file. Please review the configuration and see if you are able to relate it correctly to the code.</p><p>Before you run the test class, you need to create a small table whose script i&#8217;ve provided you in the <code>resources</code> folder. Also for this example,we will run HSQLDB in server mode, so that we can concurrently browse the tables from some backend tool and also be able to run the test code. I&#8217;ve shared a file by the name <code>starthsqldb.bat</code> in <code>resources</code> folder to help you in running  HSQLDB in server mode. Please edit the batch file if it fails.</p><p>By default when you run the test class, everything will commit and you will be able to see the changes getting reflected in the following tables: <code>tx_orders</code> , <code>tx_payments</code> and <code>tx_products</code>.</p><h1 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h1><p>If you are reading this conclusion before completing the lab, then we haven&#8217;t yet concluded. Thank you!</p></body></html>
