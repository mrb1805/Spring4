With the help of this lab we will learn different ways of injecting dependencies. There are continuous references to slide numbers all throughout the presentation.</p><h1 id="Exercise1.Setterinjectionusingxmlconfiguration">Exercise 1. Setter injection using xml configuration</h1><p>In Spring, we write POJOs for everything. To begin with you can review  <code>FlightRepositoryImpl</code> from the <code>xml</code> package. As you can see we need to inject a <code>DataSource</code> object. Open <code>xml-config-1.xml</code>  file and complete <code>TODO 1</code> by referring to <b>slide no. 21</b>. For re-usability purpose, i have moved the DataSource configuration in <code>db-config.xml</code>  file which if required can be edited to use a different database.</p><p>There is a small script which will create the required table and insert some rows in the database. I have kept a file by the name <code>script.sql</code> in the <code>resources</code> folder. You don&#8217;t need to manually run this script since i am using the jdbc namespace&#8217;s initialize-datasource element provided by Spring. We will discuss about namespaces in the next session.</p><p>To test whether the DataSource has been injected successfully or not, open <code>FlightRepositoryTest</code> class from the <code>test</code> package. You need to run it as a <em>JUnit Test Case</em> in eclipse and see if everything is okay. To understand the test code, please refer to <b>slide no. 35</b>.</p><h1 id="Exercise2.Setterinjectionusingannotations">Exercise 2. Setter injection using annotations</h1><p>Annotations are a replacement for xml style configuration. Although not 100%, but it surely reduces the amount of xml we need to maintain. In this section, we will try to annotate our bean with the necessary dependencies. Open <code>FlightRepositoryImpl</code> from the <code>annotations</code> package. Complete <code>TODO 2</code> by referring to <b>slide no. 22</b> to identify the correct annotation to be used for the setter method.</p><p>Annotations don&#8217;t work by default in Spring, we need to inform Spring about the presence of annotations in our code. Open <code>annotations-config-1.xml</code> file and complete <code>TODO 3</code> by referring to <b>slide no. 22</b>. </p><p>Now to confirm whether annotations are working or not, reuse the same test class, <code>FlightRepositoryTest</code> by just changing the name of the xml file to be loaded and that&#8217;s the power of interfaces in Java as you already know!</p><p>Also try using <code>\@Inject</code> annotation instead of <code>\@Autowired</code> and see if it is still working.</p><h1 id="Exercise3.Usingannotationsforbeandefinition">Exercise 3. Using annotations for bean definition</h1><p>As you saw, we need to still add an entry in the xml file for the <em>repository</em> class since we are using annotations for DI only. To automatically register a bean with the container, refer to <b>slide no. 25</b> and complete <code>TODO 4</code> in <code>FlightRepositoryImpl</code> from <code>annotations</code> package. When using annotations for registering a bean, the bean id can be provided as a String within the annotation used.</p><p>Open <code>annotations-config-2.xml</code> file and complete <code>TODO 5</code> by referring to <b>slide no. 25</b>. Run the test class by loading this xml file and see if it works.</p><p>Also try using <code>\@Named</code> annotation instead of <code>\@Component</code> and see if it is still working.</p><h1 id="Exercise4.Constructorinjectionusingxmlconfiguration">Exercise 4. Constructor injection using xml configuration</h1><p>Constructor injection is another way of initializing the dependencies. Rather it&#8217;s the easiest way of forcing all the dependencies to get initialized. So let&#8217;s quickly try out one example for testing out the same. Open <code>FlightRepositoryImpl2</code> from the <code>xml</code> package. You will see the same code as before but with a constructor instead of a setter method. In the <code>xml-config-2.xml</code> file, complete <code>TODO 6</code> by referring to <b>slide no. 26</b>.</p><p>Run the test class by loading <code>xml-config-2.xml</code> file and see if everything is working correctly again.</p><h1 id="Exercise5.Constructorinjectionusingannotations">Exercise 5. Constructor injection using annotations</h1><p>Open <code>FlightRepositoryImpl2</code> from the <code>annotations</code> package and complete <code>TODO 7</code> by referring to <b>slide no. 27</b>. There is no change in the xml needed since we have annotated the bean class with <em>@Repository</em> annotation. Just review the <code>annotations-config-3.xml</code> file once and run the test class by loading this xml file.</p><h1 id="Exercise6.AdditionalwaysofusingAutowiredandResourceannotation">Exercise 6. Additional ways of using @Autowired and @Resource annotation</h1><p>Both these annotations give us the freedom to go beyond constructors and setters, we can even use these annotations to initialize private fields of our bean class directly. Open <code>FlightRepositoryImpl3</code> from the <code>annotations</code> package and complete <code>TODO 8</code> by referring to <b>slide no. 29</b>. Test it as usual. </p><p>Similarly you can test the same code using <em>@Resource</em>  annotation instead of <em>@Autowired</em>  annotation and see if it&#8217;s working once again.</p><h1 id="Exercise7.Autowiringusingxmlconfiguration">Exercise 7. Autowiring using xml configuration</h1><p>Open <code>xml-config-3.xml</code> file and complete <code>TODO 9</code> by referring to <b>slide no. 31</b>. There is no change in the code, but you can still review <code>FlightRepositoryImpl3</code> from <code>xml</code> package. Reuse the same test class by loading this xml file. Try out both the ways of autowiring!</p><h1 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h1><p>So in this lab we saw how to inject the dependencies in two ways:</p><ul><li>setter injection</li><li>constructor injection</li></ul><p>Also we saw <em>XML</em> as well as <em>annotations</em> approach for DI. Finally we also understood autowiring in Spring. In the next lab, we will see more examples on <em>Dependency Injection</em>.</p></body></html>
